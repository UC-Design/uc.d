The ‘Dark Crafts Pavilion’ formed the centerpiece of the 2019 Design Canberra Festival, transforming the cities Civic Square into a meeting place of activity, discussion and chance encounter. The temporary sculptural pavilion was designed, fabricated and installed by a multidisciplinary design team of staff and students, headed up by the University of Canberra’s Iain (Max) Maxwell, the co-director of international award-winning architecture and innovation practice Supermanoeuvre.

The architectural installation was conceived as a catalyst for a new dialogue with the city; celebrating a renewed commitment to design excellence and experimentation.

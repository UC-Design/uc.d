Delivered by an interdisciplinary team of design based-researchers from the University of Canberra, this project will expose the lived-experiences of Dickson through the creation of a physical and digital installation situated in the Dickson Village shopping precinct. 

Dickson is an eclectic area comprising buildings of various shapes, sizes and uses with people from all walks of life. It is a place where things are happening: people are learning, living and growing; decisions are being made and lives changed. These are all moments of urban life that contribute to the conceptual reading of the city as a cultural artefact. We see many opportunities in considering how we can bring the embedded memories of residents and visitors to the fore, where we can learn from them, reveal insights and understand elements of our cultural identity. 

Our installation creatively replicates the Canberra Housing 300/400 series. The floor plan will be drawn at 75% scale onto the ground surface, while selected elements - wall and framing, furniture and artefacts - will be abstractly built into 3D space. The physical artefact will be supported by a bespoke digital platform developed by the creative team and linked to the installation. The digital platform will allow users to hear and view stories from the Dickson area (sourced from the National Library of Australia) and to contribute their own. In addition to activating the urban place, this will allow users to participate with the rich history of Dickson in a new and engaging way and generate new content throughout the installation's life serving the role of an important cultural repository. 

This project has received funding from the City Renewal Authority to support construction and development of both the physical artefact and digital platform.
